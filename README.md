Notes on Capstone:

-as of 06/9/2023 (commit 20198f6), I will likely have to do away with many attempts at DRY code in order to get out minimum viable product. What I implemented in the aforementioned commit would be how I would structure any subsequent components if I had the time

Deleted:
-staffpicksheader 

-categories and category images would ultimately be something that the admin could edit; currently, they are simply loaded as assets from the backend 
-added a very hasty About page just for sake of completion... to be developed
-removed Stores page - tbd
-added SignIn page - non-functional, for sake of completeness
